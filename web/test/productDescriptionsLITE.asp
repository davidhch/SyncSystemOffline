<p>PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS</p>
<p><strong>NewZapp Designed Templates</strong><br />
  Each NewZapp template is designed specifically for the customer. These templates can be branded to your business and include both editable and non editable areas. Your template will be designed to your specification. It will then be tested in standard email clients (a list of these is available on request) and your final template is loaded into your account for approval. Once you are happy with your template, we will ask you to sign an approval form. You are then ready to create, send and track email campaigns using your own NewZapp email template.</p>
